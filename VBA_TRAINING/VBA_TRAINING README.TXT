Hello,

In this file, i wrote a few simple macros that I created to use for the training of my team, mostly with no experience in codding.

They are meant to show the kind of work we can make by automating processes in excel. In this example, the macros will make be responsible for the data formating, update via VLOOKUP, calculation, sorting, and export it as a PDF report.

There is a macro that calls all subroutines and runs them in the correct order. Some of the file variables are set by inputting values on the Excell file, this was done to show how we can create a macro that can easily be configured by using excel, a very useful feature when you are dealing with other clients that may not know how to edit the VBA code but can easily change the value of a cell.
