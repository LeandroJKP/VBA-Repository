Hello,

In this project, i wrote a few simple macros that I created to use for the training of my team, mostly with no experience in codding.

They are meant to show the kind of work we can make by automating processes in excel. In this example, the macros will make be responsible for the data formating, update via VLOOKUP, calculation, sorting, and export it as a PDF report.
